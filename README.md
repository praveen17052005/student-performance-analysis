This project analyzes student performance data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It explores how various factors like gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation affect scores in math, reading, and writing.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To identify patterns and draw insights from student assessment data that can help improve academic outcomes. The analysis leverages statistical techniques and data visualization to explore:

- Score distributions
- Correlations between subjects
- Performance differences across categories

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `STUDENT_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.ipynb` — The main notebook with the complete exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- `requirements.txt` — List of Python packages used
- `.gitignore` — Git tracking exclusions
- `LICENSE` — MIT open-source license
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Students who completed a test preparation course scored higher on average.
- Lunch type and parental level of education have noticeable effects on performance.
- Math and reading scores are highly correlated.
